EverfreeBot
===========

Summary
-------
EverfreeBot is An IRC bot that announces new posts from a StatusNet instance,
specifically one for the Everfree Roleplay website, but it should be configurable
to work with any StatusNet instance.

Configuration
-------------
At the top of the script are variables which can be changed to configure the
program. Variable names should be self explanatory, with sample values given.
The config is planned to be moved to a separate file down the road, but it's in
the script itself for now.
